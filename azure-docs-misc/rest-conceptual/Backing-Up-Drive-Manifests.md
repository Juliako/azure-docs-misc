# Backing Up Drive Manifests
Drive manifests can be automatically backed up to blobs by setting the `BackupDriveManifest` property to `true` in the [Put Job](../rest-conceptual/Put-Job.md) or [Update Job Properties](../rest-conceptual/Update-Job-Properties.md) operations. By default the drive manifests are not backed up. The drive manifest backups are stored as block blobs in a container within the storage account associated with the job. By default, the container name is `waimportexport`, but you can specify a different name in the `ImportExportStatesPath` property when calling the `Put Job` or `Update Job Properties` operations. The backup manifest blob are named in the following format: `waies/jobname_driveid_timestamp_manifest.xml`.  
  
 You can retrieve the URI of the backup drive manifests for a job by calling the [Get Job](../rest-conceptual/Get-Job3.md) operation. The blob URI is returned in the `ManifestUri` property for each drive.
