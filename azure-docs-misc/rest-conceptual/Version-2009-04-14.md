# Version 2009-04-14
The 2009-04-14 version of the Azure storage services includes these changes:  
  
-   The [Copy Blob](../rest-conceptual/Copy-Blob.md) operation was introduced with the 2009-04-14 version. To call `Copy Blob`, you must specify the `x-ms-version` header.  
  
-   The [Get Block List](../rest-conceptual/Get-Block-List.md) operation offers new functionality with the 2009-04-14 version. You can now specify whether you wish to return the list of committed blocks, the list of uncommitted blocks, or both lists together. To use this new functionality, you must set the `x-ms-version` request header to 2009-04-14.  
  
-   Entity group transactions permit atomic batch operations for multiple insert, update, and delete operations against the 2009-04-14 version of the Table service. For more information, see [Performing Entity Group Transactions](../rest-conceptual/Performing-Entity-Group-Transactions.md).  
  
-   The Table service no longer supports property names, including the dash (-) character in the 2009-04-14 version.  
  
-   Beginning with the 2009-04-14 version, the Table service now supports naming properties with C# Unicode characters. For more information about naming properties, see [Understanding the Table Service Data Model](../rest-conceptual/Understanding-the-Table-Service-Data-Model.md).
