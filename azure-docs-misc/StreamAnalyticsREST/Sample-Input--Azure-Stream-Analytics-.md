# Sample Input (Azure Stream Analytics)
  ASA service will attempt to get sample events for a limited time, if there are no events in the source when it queries it would not wait, it would return zero events. ASA service will only spend a fixed amount of time to get sample events, it would return as many events as it could read within the limited time. Please note that this is a sample set of events, the order the events are received in the sample and the order the events are processed can be different.
