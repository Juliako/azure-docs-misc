# Table Service REST API
The Table service offers structured storage in the form of tables. The Table service API is a REST API for working with tables and the data that they contain.  
  
## REST API Operations  
 The REST API for the Table service includes the operations listed in the following table.  
  
|Operation|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[Set Table Service Properties](../StorageServicesREST/Set-Table-Service-Properties.md)|Sets the properties of the Table service.|  
|[Get Table Service Properties](../StorageServicesREST/Get-Table-Service-Properties.md)|Gets the properties of the Table service.|  
|[Preflight Table Request](../StorageServicesREST/Preflight-Table-Request.md)|Queries the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for the Table service prior to sending the actual request.|  
|[Get Table Service Stats](../StorageServicesREST/Get-Table-Service-Stats.md)|Retrieves statistics related to replication for the Table service. This operation is only available on the secondary location endpoint when read-access geo-redundant replication is enabled for the storage account.|  
|[Query Tables](../StorageServicesREST/Query-Tables.md)|Enumerates the tables in a storage account.|  
|[Create Table](../StorageServicesREST/Create-Table.md)|Creates a new table within a storage account.|  
|[Delete Table](../StorageServicesREST/Delete-Table.md)|Deletes a table from a storage account.|  
|[Get Table ACL](../StorageServicesREST/Get-Table-ACL.md)|Returns details about any stored access policies specified on the table that may be used with Shared Access Signatures.|  
|[Set Table ACL](../StorageServicesREST/Set-Table-ACL.md)|Sets details about any stored access policies specified on the table that may be used with Shared Access Signatures.|  
|[Query Entities](../StorageServicesREST/Query-Entities.md)|Queries data in a table.|  
|[Insert Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Insert-Entity.md)|Inserts a new entity into a table.|  
|[Insert Or Merge Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Insert-Or-Merge-Entity.md)|Inserts or merges an entity in a table.|  
|[Insert Or Replace Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Insert-Or-Replace-Entity.md)|Inserts or replaces an entity in a table.|  
|[Update Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Update-Entity2.md)|Updates an existing entity within a table by replacing it.|  
|[Merge Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Merge-Entity.md)|Updates an existing entity within a table by merging new property values into the entity.|  
|[Delete Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Delete-Entity1.md)|Deletes an entity within a table|  
  
## Entity Group Transactions  
 The Table service supports batch operations for [Insert Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Insert-Entity.md), [Update Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Update-Entity2.md), [Merge Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Merge-Entity.md), and [Delete Entity](../StorageServicesREST/Delete-Entity1.md) operations. For more information about batch operations, see [Performing Entity Group Transactions](../StorageServicesREST/Performing-Entity-Group-Transactions.md).
