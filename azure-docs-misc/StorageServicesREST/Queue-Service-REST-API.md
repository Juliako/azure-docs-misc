# Queue Service REST API
The Queue service stores messages that may be read by any client who has access to the storage account.  
  
 A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18 or newer. For previous versions, the maximum size of a message is 8KB. Messages are generally added to the end of the queue and retrieved from the front of the queue, although first in, first out (FIFO) behavior is not guaranteed.  
  
 If you need to store messages larger than 64KB, you can store message data as a blob or in a table, and then store a reference to the data as a message in a queue.  
  
 The REST API for the Queue service includes the operations shown in the following table.  
  
|Operation|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[Set Queue Service Properties](../StorageServicesREST/Set-Queue-Service-Properties.md)|Sets the properties of the Queue service.|

|[Get Messages](../StorageServicesREST/Get-Messages.md)|Retrieves a message from the queue and makes it invisible to other consumers.|  
|[Peek Messages](../StorageServicesREST/Peek-Messages.md)|Retrieves a message from the front of the queue, without changing the message visibility.|
