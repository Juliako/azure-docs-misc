##  Data sources
 
 Note that *PowerBI* and *Azure Data Lake Stores* are not able to be created using **CREATE OUTPUT** due to an authorization requirement to attach to these services.
 
PowerBI authorization is discussed in the [Power BI Dashboard article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-power-bi-dashboard/#add-power-bi-output).

Azure Data Lake Stores are discussed in the [Azure Data Lake output article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/stream-analytics-data-lake-output/#renew-data-lake-store-authorization)
