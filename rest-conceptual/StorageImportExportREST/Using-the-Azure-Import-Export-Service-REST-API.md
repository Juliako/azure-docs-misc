# Using the Azure Import-Export Service REST API
The Microsoft Azure Import/Export Service exposes a REST API to enable programmatic control of import/export jobs. You can use the REST API to perform all of the import/export operations that you can perform with the [Azure classic portal](http://www.windowsazure.com/). Additionally, you can use the REST API to perform certain granular operations, such as querying the percentage completion of a job, which are not currently available in the classic portal.  
  
 See [Using the Microsoft Azure Import/Export Service to Transfer Data to Blob Storage](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=329852&clcid=0x409) for an overview of the Import/Export service and a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the classic portal to create and manage import and export jobs.  
  
## Service Endpoints and Authentication  
 The Azure Import/Export service provides a set of REST APIs at the following HTTPS endpoint for communicating between a client and the service. Note that `<subscription-id>` is your subscription ID, available in the Azure classic portal:  
  
 `https://management.core.windows.net/<subscription-id>/services/importexport/`  
  
 To protect the security of customersâ€™ data, the service endpoint is exposed only via HTTPS, not via HTTP, and anonymous requests are not allowed.  
  
 The Import/Export service is a Microsoft Azure service and uses the Azure Service Management authentication scheme. See [Authenticating Service Management Requests](assetId:///1becb7dc-1cdc-4db4-8ae8-7e351c96c251) for details on how to authenticate requests.  
  
## Versioning  
 Requests to the Import/Export service must conform to the versioning guidelines described in [Service Management Versioning](assetId:///bb009293-529c-4793-b925-0f8701f337d2). All requests must specify the `x-ms-version` header and set its value to `2014-05-01`or `2014-11-01`.
