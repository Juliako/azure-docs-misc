# Update Job Properties
The `Update Job Properties` operation updates specific properties of a job. You can call this operation to notify the Import/Export service that the hard drives comprising the import or export job have been shipped to the Microsoft data center. An `Update Job Properties` request can also be used to cancel an existing job.  
  
## Request  
 The `Update Job Properties` request may be constructed as follows. HTTPS is required. Replace `<subscription-id>` with your subscription ID, `<storage-account-name>` with the name of your storage account, and `<jobname>` with the name of your job:  
  
|Method|Request URI|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|PATCH|`https://management.core.windows.net/subscription-id/services/importexport/storageacounts/storage-acount-name/jobs/jobname[?$format=format]`|  
  
## URI Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|`format`|**Optional.** Can be used to override the `Accept` header. See the `Accept` header for additional information.<br /><br /> The following is an example of the `$format` query parameter:<br /><br /> `$format=application/json;odata=minimalmetadata`|  
  
## Request Headers  
 The following table describes required and optional request headers.  
  
|Request Header|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|`Accept`|**Optional.** If specified, it must be `application/json` (which specifies the JSON Light format). Other values will result in response code 406 (`Not Acceptable`).<br /><br /> One of the following parameters can also be included:<br /><br /> `odata=minimalmetadata`<br /><br /> `odata=nometatadata`<br /><br /> `odata=fullmetadata`<br /><br /> The default parameter is `odata=minimalmetadata`.<br /><br /> The following is an example header:<br /><br /> `Accept: application/json;odata=minimalmetadata`|  
|`Accept-Language`|**Optional.** Currently only the values `en` and `en-us` are supported.|  
|`Content-Encoding`|**Optional.** If this header is specified, the value must be set to `identity`.|  
|`Content-Length`|**Optional.** Specifies the length of the request body.|  
|`Content-Type`|**Optional.** If this header is specified, the value must be set to `application/json`. All other values will result in status code 406 (`Not Acceptable`).|  
|`x-ms-date`|**Optional.** If specified, the value should specify the date and time when the request is sent, in the RFC 1123 format.|  
|`x-ms-version`|**Required.** Specifies the service management version to use for this request. The value of this header must be set to `2014-05-01` or `2014-11-01`.|  
|`If-Modified-Since`|**Optional.** A DateTime value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has been modified since the specified time.|  
|`If-Unmodified-Since`|**Optional.** A DateTime value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource has not been modified since the specified date/time.|  
|`If-Match`|**Optional.** An ETag value. Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag matches the value specified.|  
|`If-None-Match`|**Optional.** An ETag value, or the wildcard character (*). Specify this header to perform the operation only if the resource's ETag does not match the value specified.<br /><br /> Specify the wildcard character (\*) to perform the operation only if the resource does not exist, and fail the operation if it does exist.|  
|`X-HTTP-Method`|Optional. If this header is specified, its value must be PATCH and the request HTTP verb must be GET. The request will be processed as if it were a PATCH request.|

## Remarks  
 The `Update Job Properties` operation enables you to update properties of a job after the job has been created. After you ship your drives to a Windows Azure data center, you are required to update certain fields before your job can be processed.  
  
 Some properties, like the `Metadata` property, may be updated at any time during the lifetime of a job, whereas the `DeliveryPackage` property can only be updated prior to the package's arrival at the Windows Azure data center.  
  
 The table below describes when various properties can be changed.  
  
|Property|Comments|  
|--------------|--------------|  
|`FriendlyName`|May be updated at any time.|  
|`Description`|May be updated at any time.|  
|`Metadata`|May be updated at any time.|  
|`State`|May only be updated when the status of the job is `Creating`.|  
|`CancelRequested`|May be updated when the status of the job is `Creating`, `Shipping`, or `Transferring`.|  
|`ReturnAddress`|May be updated until the status of the job is `Packaging`.|  
|`ReturnShipping`|May be updated until the status of the job is `Packaging`.|  
|`DeliveryPackage`|May be updated until all drives arrive at the datacenter.|  
|`EnableVerboseLog`|May be updated until the status of the job is `Packaging`.|  
|`BackupDriveManifest`|May be updated until the status of the job is `Packaging`.|  
|`ManagementCertificate`|May be updated until the status of the job is `Transferring`.|  
  
 You can call `Update Job Properties` to update your shipping information, or to cancel a job. These two functions are described in detail below.  
  
### Shipping  
 After you ship your drives, you must call `Update Job Properties` with the `State` property set to `Shipping`, and with the `ReturnAddress` and `DeliveryPackage` properties set to valid values. In this way you notify the Import/Export service that your drives have been shipped.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Failure to set these properties or to notify the Import/Export service that the drives have shipped may result in delays in processing your import or export job.  
  
### Cancellation  
 To cancel a job, you must call `Update Job Properties` and set the `CancelRequested` property to `true`. You can cancel a job if its state is `Creating`, `Shipping`, or `Transferring,` but not if the state is `Packaging`.  
  
 When you cancel a job, any drives that have not entered the data transfer process will be skipped. The job will be completed for any drives that are already in the data transfer process.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The Import/Export service cancels a job on a best effort basis, but there are no guarantees about the success of a cancellation request.  
  
### Conditional Headers  
 You can call `Update Job Properties` with conditional headers specified to update the job only when certain conditions are met. When specifying conditional headers, keep in mind the following:  
  
-   If a request specifies both the `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-None-Match`.  
  
-   If a request specifies both the `If-Match` and `If-Unmodified-Since` headers, the request is evaluated based on the criteria specified in `If-Match`.  
  
-   With the exception of the two combinations of conditional headers listed above, a request may specify only a single conditional header. Specifying more than one conditional header results in status code 400 (`Bad Request`).  
  
 The following table indicates the response codes returned for an unmet condition for each conditional header:  
  
|Conditional header|Response code if condition has not been met|  
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|  
|`If-Modified-Since`|Precondition Failed (412)|  
|`If-Unmodified-Since`|Precondition Failed (412)|  
|`If-Match`|Precondition Failed (412)|  
|`If-None-Match`|Precondition Failed (412)|
